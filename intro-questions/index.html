        <h1>Intro Questions</h1> 

        <p>1. My name is Lena Viersen. I am a junior in Sam Fox studying Communication Design with a minor in Business of the Arts.</p>

        <p>2. While this is a required class for me, I did go into college thinking of double majoring or minoring in Computer Science. After taking CSE 131, I defineitely learned that side of coding wasn't for me. However I am excited to explore HTML/CSS/JS coding and it is already making a lot more sense to me! </p> 
        
        <p>3. I have no experience with HTML/CSS/JS. </p>

        <p>4. I really just want to explore coding in HTML/CSS/JS. I took a class where we learned in Java, which was very confusing for me. This area seems manageable and I just am excited to see all the differences and learning what coding in these new laguages really means. </p>

        <p>5. Designing on screen seems to be a much more conceptual area which I can't tell if I like yet or not. I am not a huge fan of sketching thumbnails repeatedly for classes but I do have a hard to visually just in my head. Designing on screen cuts out the sketching of working on paper, but I am interested to see how working more conceptually will be. </p>

        <p>6. I love the design of https://neal.fun/deep-sea/ . I love the interactive nature of the website and illustrations and information are well organized and clear.</p>

        <p>7. Though I don't enjoy the design of https://poshmark.com I have always found the objective of the website very clear. I know how to use it from the way that they have communicated the point of the website.</p>

        <p>8. One of my favorite websites is https://www.pinterest.com/ . It functions just as well as their app but with a larger screen, it feels more interactive and enjoyable. It is not overrun with ads and allows users a relaxing time.</p>
