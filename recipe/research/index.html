        <h1>The Best Banana Bread</h1>
        <h2>The batter for this easy-to-make banana bread is enriched with sour cream, which gives it a subtle tang and super moist texture. In order to avoid this quick bread becoming tough and chewy, don't overmix the batter.</h2>
        <br>
        <p class="title">Ingredients</p>
        <p>1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, at room temperature, plus more for pan</p>
        <p>1 cup sugar</p>
        <p>2 large eggs</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon baking soda</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon kosher salt</p>
        <p>1 cup mashed very ripe bananas</p>
        <p>1/2 cup sour cream</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</p>
        <p>(optional) 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans</p>
        <br>
        <p class="title">Instructions</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Step 1</p>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9-by-5-by-3-inch loaf pan; set aside. In an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs and beat to incorporate.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Step 2</p>
        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt. Add to the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Add bananas, sour cream, and vanilla; mix to combine. Stir in nuts and pour into prepared pan.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Step 3</p>
        <p>Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes. Let rest in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a rack to cool.</p>
