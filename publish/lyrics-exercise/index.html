            <p>You're falling asleep
            <br>
            On my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
            <br>
            We're coming home from a sermon
            <br>
            Saying how bent and evil we are
            <br>
            I tried to imagine what you're dreaming
            <br>
            You're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
            <br>
            I have to wake you up to get out
            <br>
            Your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house
            <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>He can be nice, sometimes
            <br>
            Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
            <br>
            All in all, nobody's perfect
            <br>
            There may be better, but you don't feel worth it
            <br>
            That's where we disagree
            <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
            <br>
            Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
            <br>
            Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
            <br>
            I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother
            <br>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            But if you get married, I'd object
            <br>
            Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
            <br>
            I'd rather lose my dignity
            <br>
            Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy
            <br>
            </p>
            <br>
